Overall there is no major trends, akthough there does seem to be an increase in major hurricanes since the 1980's, although its not as massive as I thought.
All of these come in waves. 
I don't know too much about meteorology, but I'd assume that this has something to do with global patterns like el nino or something. Cat 1 really seems to spike too.
Some trends includ a lull in the 1980's. 
Many of these trends might be errors with copying charts with wikipedia.
In addition, category 4 were formatted differently. May go back if I have time but for now I will just skip them.
