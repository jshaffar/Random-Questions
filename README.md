# Random-Questions
Sometimes I just have a question i want to answer with actual data rather than just making stuff up like I normally do, so this seems like a good place to do it. Usually do this if I have free time and wanna learn some sort of programming skill i.e web scraping. Note that these answers are highly unscientific in some, and just for fun and personal knowledge and learning.
